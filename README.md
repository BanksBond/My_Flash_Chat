# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Goal

The objective of this project was to learn how to incorporate Firebase into our Flutter apps. We'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip our app with a cloud based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.


## What I've created

I build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
